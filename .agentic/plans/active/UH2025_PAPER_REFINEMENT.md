# UH2025 Paper Refinement & Hybrid Authorship Plan (Completed)

**Goal:** Establish a robust "Hybrid Human-AI Authorship" framework within the `paper/` directory, backed by deep research and "Context-as-Code" structures.

## 1. Root-Level Architecture ("The Newsroom") (Done)
- [x] **`paper/AGENTS.md` (New)**: Created the "Editor-in-Chief" operational manual.
    - Defined the "Hybrid Protocol": Humans set the *Thesis* and *Constraints*; Agents perform *Drafting* and *Validation*.
    - Defined the "Review Loop": How agents should process human critiques.
- [x] **`paper/README.md` (Update)**: Refined the human-facing guide.
    - Added "Contributor Guide" and explained file types (`AGENTS.md` vs `CONTEXT_PAYLOAD.md`).
    - Integrated Wilhelm Foundation mission and Hackathon context.

## 2. Section Deep Research & Refinement ("The Beat") (Done)
Iterated through key sections to inject "Deep Research" (2024-2025 literature) and strengthen local context.

### Priority A: Technical Core (Sections 05, 06, 04)
- [x] **Research Pattern**: Established `paper/research/` directory for non-intrusive findings.
- [x] **Section 05 (Agentic AI)**: Validated "Hub-and-Spoke" model and "Agentic AI" terminology vs Chatbots.
- [x] **Section 06 (Federation)**: Validated "Swarm Learning" and GA4GH standards.
- [x] **Section 04 (Multi-Omics)**: Validated Long-Read/Methylation yield increases (13%).

### Priority B: Clinical & Validation (Sections 01, 02, 08)
- [x] **Section 01 (Intro)**: Integrated "Diagnostic Odyssey" stats (350M people) and Cederroth family legacy.
- [x] **Section 02 (Hackathon)**: Framed the event as a "Clinical Trial for AI".
- [x] **Section 08 (Validation)**: Integrated "Project Baby Bear" economic savings ($2.5M).

### Priority C: Ethics & Future (Sections 09, 10)
- [x] **Section 09 (Ethics)**: Integrated EU AI Act "High Risk" compliance and WHO Data Equity.
- [x] **Section 10 (Future)**: Defined the "Living Diagnosis" vision.

## 3. Presentation Context Synchronization (Done)
- [x] **Payload Review**: Updated `.agentic/outputs/presentation/MASTER_CONTEXT.md`.
- [x] **Sync**: Linked Master Context to the new Research Findings artifacts.

## 4. Execution Logic
- **Storage**: Plan stored in `.agentic/plans/active/UH2025_PAPER_REFINEMENT.md`.
- **Status**: **COMPLETED**.

## Next Steps
1.  **Drafting**: Agents can now be tasked to "Draft Section 05 using `paper/sections/05_agentic_ai/AGENTS.md` and `paper/research/05_agentic_ai/FINDINGS.md`."
2.  **Visuals**: Use the `CONTEXT_PAYLOAD.md` files to generate Mermaid diagrams for each section.
