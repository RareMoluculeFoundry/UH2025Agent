# The Wilhelm Foundation Undiagnosed Rare Disease Hackathon

**The Inspiration Behind UH2025-CDS-Agent**

---

## The Story

In September 2025, something extraordinary happened at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. Nearly 130 researchers, clinicians, and data scientists from 28 countries gathered for three intense days with a single mission: to diagnose the undiagnosed.

**The bell rang six times.**

Each time that bell rang, it meant a family who had waited years—sometimes decades—finally had an answer. Six confirmed diagnoses. Eight more families believed to have answers within reach. Twenty-nine rare disease cases tackled in total.

This was the Wilhelm Foundation Undiagnosed Rare Disease Hackathon.

## Why This Hackathon Exists

### The Founders' Story

Helene and Mikk Cederroth of Sweden know the pain of rare disease more intimately than most. They lost three of their four children to an undiagnosed genetic condition. The agony of watching their children suffer without knowing why—without a name for what was happening—without knowing if it could be treated or prevented—drove them to action.

From their grief emerged the Wilhelm Foundation, named in honor of their children. Their mission: to ensure other families don't endure the same fate.

### The Global Crisis

The Cederroths' tragedy is shared by millions:

- **350 million people** worldwide are affected by rare diseases
- **~7,000 rare diseases** have been identified
- **80% have a genetic origin**
- **50% affect children**
- Only **~40% of cases** yield to existing diagnostic approaches
- Average **7+ years** to receive a diagnosis ("the diagnostic odyssey")
- Many families **never receive a diagnosis**

For the ~60% of rare disease patients who remain undiagnosed, each day brings uncertainty, misdiagnosis, and the weight of not knowing.

## The Hackathon Model

### What Made It Work

The hackathon demonstrated that rare disease diagnosis isn't just a technical problem—it's a collaboration problem. Cases that had stumped individual specialists for years yielded when diverse expertise converged:

**The Teams:**
- Clinical geneticists who understand phenotypes
- Bioinformaticians who can interpret variant data
- Data scientists who can find patterns in complex datasets
- Domain experts in specific disease areas
- Patient advocates who provide crucial context

**The Approach:**
1. **Intensive focus**: 72 hours of concentrated attention on each case
2. **Fresh perspectives**: Experts from different institutions and countries
3. **Collective intelligence**: Real-time collaboration and knowledge sharing
4. **Advanced tools**: Access to latest databases, prediction algorithms, and analysis pipelines
5. **Patient partnership**: Families as active participants, not just data sources

### Leadership

The hackathon was co-led by:
- **Dr. Eric Klee** - Mayo Clinic computational biologist and genomics expert
- **Dr. Cherisse Marcou** - Clinical geneticist specializing in rare diseases

Their vision: create a repeatable model for collaborative rare disease diagnosis that can scale beyond a single event.

## From Hackathon to Agent

### The Key Insight

The hackathon revealed a critical bottleneck: **human experts are the scarcest resource**.

While 130 brilliant minds came together for three days, the 350 million people with rare diseases can't all attend a hackathon. The question became:

> *How do we capture and scale the collaborative intelligence demonstrated at the hackathon?*

### The UH2025 Agent Vision

The UH2025-CDS-Agent doesn't aim to replace the hackathon model—it aims to amplify it:

1. **Pre-processing at scale**: Handle the tedious data organization that consumes expert time
2. **Evidence marshaling**: Gather and organize relevant evidence from databases and literature
3. **Hypothesis generation**: Generate initial diagnostic hypotheses for expert refinement
4. **Knowledge preservation**: Learn from expert corrections to improve over time

Think of it as giving every expert a tireless colleague who handles paperwork so they can focus on the hard diagnostic reasoning.

### Why On-Premise?

Patient data is sacred. The families who come to hackathons trust that their genomic data and medical histories will be protected. The UH2025 Agent runs entirely on local hardware for a reason:

- **Privacy first**: No patient data leaves the device
- **HIPAA compliant**: Local execution means simpler compliance
- **Universal access**: Works without cloud dependencies or internet
- **Trust**: Patients can see exactly where their data lives

## What Success Looks Like

### For Individual Families

A diagnosis means:
- **Knowing**: Finally understanding what's happening
- **Community**: Connecting with others who share the condition
- **Treatment options**: Access to therapies (if available) or clinical trials
- **Planning**: Informed decisions about family planning and life choices
- **Closure**: An end to the diagnostic odyssey

### For the Field

The hackathon model, enhanced by AI assistance, could:
- **Scale expert impact**: One expert's time multiplied many times over
- **Democratize access**: Advanced diagnostic capabilities for under-resourced institutions
- **Accelerate research**: Patterns discovered across cases inform new discoveries
- **Build knowledge**: Every case contributes to improving future diagnoses

---

## The Path Forward

The UH2025 Agent is one piece of a larger vision:

1. **Local deployment**: Enable any clinic to run sophisticated diagnostic assistance
2. **Expert network**: Connect to specialists worldwide for difficult cases
3. **Federated learning**: Improve collectively without centralizing sensitive data
4. **Research integration**: Feed discoveries back into the scientific literature

The hackathon proved that rare diseases can be solved—with the right people, the right tools, and enough focused attention. The agent aims to make that equation work at scale.
