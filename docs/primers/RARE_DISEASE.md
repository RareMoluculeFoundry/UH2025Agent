# Rare Disease Primer

**Understanding the Landscape of Rare and Undiagnosed Diseases**

---

## What is a Rare Disease?

### Definitions Vary by Jurisdiction

| Region | Definition | Threshold |
|--------|------------|-----------|
| **United States** | Affects <200,000 people | ~1 in 1,650 |
| **European Union** | Affects <1 in 2,000 people | ~1 in 2,000 |
| **Japan** | Affects <50,000 people | ~1 in 2,500 |
| **Australia** | Affects <2,000 people | ~1 in 13,000 |

Despite the "rare" designation, rare diseases collectively are common:

- **~7,000** distinct rare diseases identified
- **350+ million** people affected worldwide
- **1 in 10** people will have a rare disease in their lifetime
- **80%** have a genetic origin
- **50%** affect children

### The Paradox of Rare Diseases

Individual rare diseases are uncommon, but:
- Rare disease patients collectively number more than cancer patients
- A typical primary care physician will see rare disease patients
- Any specialist can encounter rare diseases in their domain
- The challenge is recognizing them among common conditions

## The Diagnostic Odyssey

### What It Means

The "diagnostic odyssey" describes the long, difficult journey rare disease patients face:

| Metric | Typical Experience |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Time to diagnosis** | 7+ years average |
| **Physicians consulted** | 7+ specialists on average |
| **Misdiagnoses received** | 2-3 before correct diagnosis |
| **Percentage never diagnosed** | 30-50% |

### Why Diagnosis Takes So Long

**Rarity itself:**
- Most physicians have never seen the condition
- Textbook knowledge may not match real presentations
- Index of suspicion is low for rare conditions

**Heterogeneity:**
- Same disease can present differently in different patients
- Symptoms may develop gradually over years
- Phenotypes overlap with common conditions

**Healthcare fragmentation:**
- Patients see multiple specialists who don't communicate
- Each specialist sees only their organ system
- No one integrates the full picture

**Limited awareness:**
- Medical education emphasizes common diseases
- "When you hear hoofbeats, think horses not zebras"
- Rare diseases are the zebras—systematically under-considered

### The Human Cost

The diagnostic odyssey imposes enormous burdens:

**Medical:**
- Inappropriate treatments based on wrong diagnoses
- Disease progression while searching for answers
- Missed windows for intervention
- Unnecessary procedures and tests

**Financial:**
- Repeated specialist visits and tests
- Travel to expert centers
- Lost productivity
- Insurance battles

**Psychological:**
- Uncertainty and fear
- Feeling disbelieved ("it's all in your head")
- Grief without closure
- Strain on relationships and families

**Social:**
- Isolation from peers who don't understand
- Identity shaped by illness
- Career and educational disruption
- Planning difficulties (family, financial)

## The Genetic Basis of Rare Diseases

### Why 80% Are Genetic

Rare diseases disproportionately have genetic causes because:

1. **Common genetic variants cause common diseases**: Natural selection removes severely harmful variants; what remains is either rare or mild
2. **De novo mutations**: New mutations in each generation can cause severe conditions that don't persist in populations
3. **Recessive inheritance**: Two carriers can produce affected children even if neither parent is affected
4. **Rare variant, rare disease**: The rarity of the genetic cause creates the rarity of the condition

### Inheritance Patterns

| Pattern | Description | Example Diseases |
|---------|-------------|------------------|
| **Autosomal Dominant** | One copy of variant sufficient | Marfan syndrome, Huntington's |
| **Autosomal Recessive** | Two copies required | Cystic fibrosis, PKU |
| **X-linked** | Variant on X chromosome | Duchenne MD, Hemophilia |
| **Mitochondrial** | Maternal inheritance | MELAS, Leigh syndrome |
| **De novo** | New mutation in patient | Many developmental disorders |

### The Variant Spectrum

Not all genetic variants are equal:

| Variant Type | Description | Discovery |
|--------------|-------------|-----------|
| **Single Nucleotide Variant (SNV)** | Single base change | Most common finding |
| **Indel** | Small insertion or deletion | Common, often frameshift |
| **Copy Number Variant (CNV)** | Deletion or duplication of segments | Cytogenetic or specialized analysis |
| **Structural Variant (SV)** | Large rearrangements | Difficult to detect |
| **Repeat Expansion** | Repeated sequences expand | Specialized testing required |

## Categories of Rare Diseases

### By System Affected

| Category | Examples | Prevalence |
|----------|----------|------------|
| **Neurological** | Huntington's, ALS, SMA | ~25% of rare diseases |
| **Metabolic** | PKU, Gaucher, Fabry | ~15% of rare diseases |
| **Immune/Hematologic** | SCID, hemophilia | ~10% of rare diseases |
| **Cardiovascular** | Long QT, HCM | ~10% of rare diseases |
| **Musculoskeletal** | Marfan, EDS, DMD | ~10% of rare diseases |
| **Other/Multi-system** | Various | ~30% of rare diseases |

### By Age of Onset

| Onset | Characteristics | Examples |
|-------|-----------------|----------|
| **Congenital** | Present at birth | Many metabolic disorders |
| **Infantile** | First year of life | SMA Type 1, Tay-Sachs |
| **Childhood** | Pediatric presentation | DMD, cystic fibrosis |
| **Adolescent** | Teenage years | Friedreich ataxia |
| **Adult** | Late onset | Huntington's, some HCM |

### Ultra-Rare Diseases

Some diseases are even rarer than rare:

- **Fewer than 1 in 50,000** affected
- Often only a handful of cases worldwide
- May be described in single case reports
- Limited research due to small patient numbers
- Treatment development challenging (no statistical power for trials)

## The Undiagnosed Problem

### Why Do People Remain Undiagnosed?

**Known disease, unrecognized:**
- Disease exists in literature but physician doesn't recognize it
- Atypical presentation doesn't match textbook description
- Required testing not ordered or available

**Known gene, unknown disease:**
- Variant found in known gene
- But phenotype doesn't match documented disorders
- Could be novel disease mechanism

**Novel disease:**
- Neither gene nor disease previously described
- First cases in world/literature
- Discovery requires research, not just diagnosis

**Complex inheritance:**
- Multiple genes contributing
- Modifier effects
- Gene-environment interactions
- Doesn't fit simple Mendelian patterns

**Technical limitations:**
- Variant not detectable by current methods
- Relevant tissue not accessible
- Mosaicism below detection threshold
- Non-coding variants in uncharacterized regions

### The Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN)

The NIH established the UDN to address the undiagnosed:

**Structure:**
- Network of academic medical centers
- Multidisciplinary evaluation
- Advanced genomic analysis
- Research orientation

**Outcomes:**
- ~30% diagnosis rate (vs ~40% general)
- Novel disease discovery
- Research publications
- Model system development

**Lessons learned:**
- Collaboration is essential
- Fresh eyes find missed diagnoses
- Advanced technology helps but isn't sufficient
- Human expertise remains central

## Why Rare Diseases Matter

### Scientific Importance

Rare diseases illuminate biology:

- **Gene function**: Knockout phenotypes in humans
- **Pathway discovery**: Metabolic disorders reveal biochemistry
- **Drug targets**: Understanding disease mechanisms suggests treatments
- **Model systems**: Rare diseases inspire research models

Many breakthrough therapies started with rare diseases:
- Statins (from familial hypercholesterolemia)
- Enzyme replacement therapy (from Gaucher disease)
- Gene therapy (from rare immunodeficiencies)

### Humanitarian Imperative

Despite being "rare," millions suffer:

- Every rare disease patient is someone's child, parent, sibling
- Long diagnostic odysseys cause immense suffering
- Many rare diseases are severe or fatal
- Children are disproportionately affected

### Economic Reality

Rare disease diagnosis and treatment is economically significant:

- **$1 trillion** annual global cost estimated
- Diagnostic testing market growing rapidly
- Orphan drug development incentivized
- Employer productivity affected

## The Changing Landscape

### Genomic Revolution

Next-generation sequencing has transformed rare disease diagnosis:

| Era | Technology | Diagnostic Yield |
|-----|------------|------------------|
| **Pre-2010** | Single-gene testing | <10% per test |
| **2010-2015** | Gene panels | 20-30% |
| **2015-2020** | Exome sequencing | 30-40% |
| **2020+** | Genome sequencing | 40-50% |

**But**: Technology alone isn't enough. Interpretation requires expertise.

### Growing Resources

| Resource | Description | Impact |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| **ClinVar** | Variant interpretations | Standardizing classification |
| **OMIM** | Gene-disease relationships | Cataloging knowledge |
| **gnomAD** | Population frequencies | Filtering common variants |
| **HPO** | Phenotype ontology | Standardizing clinical descriptions |

### Collaborative Models

The hackathon model demonstrates:
- Bringing diverse expertise together works
- Concentrated attention cracks difficult cases
- Community approaches scale better than individual effort

This is the model UH2025 Agent aims to support and amplify.
