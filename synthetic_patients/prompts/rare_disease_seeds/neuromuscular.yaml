generation_prompt: |
  Generate a realistic clinical summary for a patient with suspected
  neuromuscular disease. Consider:

  - Distribution of weakness (proximal vs distal vs facial)
  - Age of onset and progression pattern
  - Family history and inheritance pattern
  - Associated features (cardiac, respiratory, cognitive)
  - Lab findings (CK level, EMG pattern)
  - Functional impact (ambulation, stairs, rising from floor)

  Clinical pearls:
  - DMD: onset <5yo, Gowers sign, pseudohypertrophy, frameshift
  - BMD: milder DMD, in-frame mutations, cardiac may precede skeletal
  - DM1: distal > proximal, myotonia, cataracts, frontal balding
  - FSHD: asymmetric, face-shoulder-arm, scapular winging
  - SMA: proximal, tongue fasciculations, normal cognition
  - Pompe: respiratory > limb, enzyme deficiency
