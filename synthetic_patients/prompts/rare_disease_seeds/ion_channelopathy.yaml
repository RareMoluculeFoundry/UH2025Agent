# Generation prompt for LLM
generation_prompt: |
  Generate a realistic clinical summary for a patient with suspected
  ion channelopathy. The presentation should include:

  - Episodic symptoms (stiffness OR weakness)
  - Triggering factors (cold, exercise, potassium-rich food, rest after exercise)
  - Age of onset (typically childhood to young adult)
  - Family history suggestive of autosomal dominant inheritance
  - EMG findings if available (myotonic discharges)

  Common clinical pearls:
  - Paramyotonia: WORSENS with activity (opposite of myotonia congenita)
  - Cold is a classic trigger for SCN4A-related disorders
  - HyperKPP: weakness with elevated potassium
  - HypoPP: weakness with low potassium
  - Grip myotonia: difficulty releasing handshake
  - Percussion myotonia: sustained muscle contraction after tapping
