generation_prompt: |
  Generate a realistic clinical summary for a patient with suspected
  connective tissue disorder. Consider:

  - Skeletal features (tall stature, arm span, joint laxity)
  - Cardiovascular findings (aortic measurements, valvular disease)
  - Ocular features (lens position, myopia)
  - Skin findings (elasticity, fragility, scarring)
  - Family history and pattern of inheritance
  - Multi-system involvement

  Clinical pearls:
  - Marfan: ectopia lentis UP and OUT, aortic root, FBN1
  - vEDS: thin translucent skin, arterial/organ rupture, COL3A1
  - Classical EDS: skin hyperextensibility, atrophic scars, COL5A1/2
  - hEDS: most common, hypermobility, pain, no known gene
  - Loeys-Dietz: bifid uvula, arterial tortuosity, TGFBR1/2
  - OI: fractures, blue sclerae, dentinogenesis imperfecta
