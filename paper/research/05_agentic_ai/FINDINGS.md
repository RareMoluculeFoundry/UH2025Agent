# Research Findings: Agentic AI in Bioinformatics (2024-2025)

**Date:** 2025-12-03
**Topic:** Section 05 - Agentic AI Workflows

## 1. Key Trends & Definitions
*   **Agentic AI Definition**: Systems capable of autonomous goal achievement with minimal supervision, exhibiting adaptability and proactivity. Distinguished from traditional automation by its ability to handle dynamic, multistep tasks.
*   **Adoption**: Significant enterprise adoption in 2025 (79% of organizations reporting some level of use), with a focus on performance optimization and development assistance.
*   **"Hub-and-Spoke" Architecture**: A common design pattern where a central "Orchestrator" agent manages specialized "Sub-agents" (e.g., for data processing, literature review).

## 2. Relevant Papers & Frameworks
*   **BioMaster / CellAgent (Inferred Context)**: While specific papers were not retrieved in full text, the search context alludes to "specialized agents" for scientific tasks.
*   **AIssistant Framework (arXiv:2509.12282)**: Modular tools for literature synthesis and citation management.
*   **XtraGPT (arXiv:2505.11336)**: Context-aware writing assistance for scientific manuscripts.
*   **OmniScientist (arXiv:2511.16931)**: Simulates human scientific systems, supporting end-to-end automation from data foundation to peer review.

## 3. Security & Ethics
*   **Risks**: "Agent Washing" (rebranding tools as agents), Cross-Prompt Injection (XPIA).
*   **Mitigation**: Microsoft's "Agentic OS" principles—human approval for critical decisions, tamper-evident logs.

## 4. Synthesis for UH2025
*   **Validation of Approach**: The UH2025 "Planner-Executor" model aligns perfectly with the industry standard "Hub-and-Spoke" architecture.
*   **New References**: We should cite the *concept* of "OmniScientist" as a parallel to our "Digital Bioinformatician" goal.
*   **Terminology**: Ensure we use "Agentic AI" rather than just "LLM Agents" to emphasize the *autonomy* aspect.
