## 1. Key Trends & Definitions
*   **The EU AI Act (2025 Impact)**: Medical AI agents are classified as "High Risk."
    *   *Constraint*: They require "Human Oversight" (Article 14). An AI cannot make a final diagnosis without a doctor signing off.
    *   *Constraint*: They require "Data Governance" (Article 10). Training data must be relevant and representative to avoid bias.
*   **Hallucination Liability**: Who is sued if the AI is wrong? The "Planner-Executor" model helps here:
    *   The *Executor* (deterministic code) is auditable.
    *   The *Planner* (LLM) is the risk. We mitigate this by having the Planner *write* code, but the *Executor* produces the result.
*   **WHO & Global Equity**: The World Health Organization warns against "Genomic Data Colonialism."
    *   *Principle*: Data should stay in the country of origin.
    *   *Solution*: Federated Learning (Section 06) is the *only* compliant architecture for global rare disease collaboration.

## 2. Wilhelm Foundation Context
*   **The "Silver Lining"**: The foundation's focus is not just medical but *holistic*. The AI must not treat the patient as a "broken machine" but as a person.
*   **Low/Middle Income Countries (LMIC)**: 80% of rare disease patients live in LMICs. A $1M diagnostic tool is useless there. A **Software Agent** that runs on a laptop is a game changer.

## 3. The "Future Standard of Care"
*   **2030 Vision**: Every child born is sequenced (WGS).
*   **The "Digital Twin"**: The Agent doesn't stop working after diagnosis. It monitors new literature forever. If a new therapy is discovered in 2028 for a patient diagnosed in 2025, the Agent flags it.
*   **Democratization**: Access to "Mayo Clinic level" diagnosis via an API.

## 4. Synthesis for UH2025
*   **Section 09 (Ethics)**: Address the "Black Box" fear. We use *Explainable AI* (Chain-of-Thought logs). We use *Federation* for sovereignty.
*   **Section 10 (Future)**: End with the "Living Diagnosis." The Hackathon is the spark, but the *Network* is the fire that keeps burning.
