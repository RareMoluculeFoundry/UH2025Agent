## 1. Key Trends & Definitions
*   **The Diagnostic Odyssey**: The average time to diagnosis for rare disease patients is 4-5 years, involving 7+ specialists.
*   **Global Burden**: Estimated 350 million people worldwide live with an undiagnosed disease.
*   **Economic Impact**: The cost of *not* diagnosing is staggering. Patients undergo unnecessary surgeries, ineffective treatments, and long hospital stays.
*   **Project Baby Bear**: A landmark study demonstrating that rapid WGS for NICU infants saves money ($2.5M in savings for 178 infants) by reducing hospital days and directing treatment.

## 2. Wilhelm Foundation Context
*   **Origin Story**: Founded by Mikk and Helene Cederroth after losing three children (Wilhelm, Hugo, Emma) to an undiagnosed degenerative disease. This personal tragedy drives the mission.
*   **Undiagnosed Hackathon**: The 2025 event at Mayo Clinic (Sep 21-23) is a key validation point for the "Swarm" approach.
*   **Undiagnosed Day**: April 29th. A global day of awareness.

## 3. The "N=1" Problem
*   **Definition**: In rare disease, every patient is an edge case. Statistical methods that work for diabetes (N=1,000,000) fail here.
*   **Solution**: "Matchmaking". We don't need a P-value; we need a match. If Patient A (Brazil) and Patient B (Japan) share the same novel variant and phenotype, that IS the proof.

## 4. Synthesis for UH2025
*   **Section 01 (Intro)**: Start with the "Cederroth Story". It grounds the technical paper in human reality. Cite the "350 Million" figure.
*   **Section 02 (Hackathon)**: Position the Hackathon not as a "coding contest" but as a "Clinical Trial for AI". We tested if agents could replicate the work of top geneticists.
*   **Section 08 (Validation)**: Use "Project Baby Bear" economics to justify the cost of the Agentic System. "If an agent costs $50 in compute but saves $10,000 in ICU days, it is a moral imperative."
