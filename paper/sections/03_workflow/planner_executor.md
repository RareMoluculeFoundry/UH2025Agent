# Deconstructing the Workflow: The Human "Data Generation Loop"

## 3.1 The Manual "Planner-Executor" Dynamic

Observation of the Hackathon teams reveals a distinct bipartite cognitive process that underpins the diagnostic workflow. This process, often implicit in clinical practice, becomes explicit in the high-pressure environment of the Hackathon.

The senior diagnosticians function as "Planners." They review the comprehensive clinical phenotype—symptoms, family history, imaging, and prior negative tests—and formulate a high-level hypothesis. For example, a Planner might hypothesize, "This patient's combination of seizures and developmental delay suggests a mosaic variant in a neurodevelopmental pathway that was missed by short-read sequencing." Based on this hypothesis, they create a "Tool List"—a specific set of instructions for the technical team.[16]

The bioinformaticians then act as "Executors." They translate these high-level clinical requests into command-line operations. This might involve running specific variant callers like DeepVariant, filtering VCF files for de novo mutations, visualizing read alignments in IGV (Integrated Genomics Viewer), or checking methylation patterns in specific genomic regions.[16] They return the processed results—often in the form of lists of candidate variants or visualizations—to the Planner.

## 3.2 The Iterative Loop and Cognitive Bottlenecks

This "Planner-Executor" interaction is not linear but cyclic. The Planner evaluates the results from the Executor. If the hypothesis is not supported (e.g., no variants found in the candidate gene), the Planner refines the hypothesis (e.g., "Maybe it's a deep intronic variant affecting splicing") and triggers a new loop with a revised Tool List.[13]

While effective in the context of the Hackathon, this manual loop has critical limitations that prevent scalability:

- **Latency:** The feedback loop between hypothesis generation and data validation is slowed by human communication and manual data handling. Even at the Hackathon, this cycle can take hours.
- **Cognitive Load:** "Planners" are limited by their personal knowledge base. A single clinician, no matter how expert, cannot memorize the phenotypes of all 10,000+ rare diseases or the technical nuances of every new bioinformatic tool.[1]
- **Resource Scarcity:** There is a severe global shortage of medical geneticists and expert bioinformaticians. Surveys indicate high burnout rates and unfilled vacancies in the field, with 40% of geneticists reporting burnout and significant delays for patient appointments.[18]

## 3.3 The "Tool List" as a Proxy for Agentic Reasoning

The "Tool List" generated by the clinicians is the critical artifact of the Hackathon. It represents the logic of diagnosis—the decision to look at long-read structural variants instead of short-read SNPs, or to investigate methylation outliers in a specific region. This decision-making process—choosing which tool to use and when—is exactly what must be modeled by AI agents to transition from "automated" pipelines (which just run a script from A to Z) to "agentic" workflows (which reason about the data and adapt the path accordingly).[16]

### 3.3.1 Example Tool Lists from Hackathon

**Case Type: Suspected Neurodevelopmental Disorder**

| Step | Tool | Rationale | Expected Output |
|------|------|-----------|-----------------|
| 1 | DeepVariant (WGS) | Initial SNV/Indel calling | Candidate variants VCF |
| 2 | OMIM Query | Filter for NDD-associated genes | Gene panel list |
| 3 | AlphaMissense | Score missense pathogenicity | Pathogenicity scores |
| 4 | ClinVar Lookup | Check clinical significance | Classification status |
| 5 | Long-read SV calling | If Step 1-4 negative, check structural variants | SV candidates |
| 6 | Methylation analysis | If SV negative, check episignatures | Methylation outliers |

**Case Type: Suspected Repeat Expansion Disorder (e.g., Ataxia)**

| Step | Tool | Rationale | Expected Output |
|------|------|-----------|-----------------|
| 1 | ExpansionHunter | Target known repeat loci | Repeat allele sizes |
| 2 | STRipy | Long-read repeat sizing | Phased repeat lengths |
| 3 | OMIM Query | Match expansion size to phenotype | Candidate diagnoses |
| 4 | RNA-seq splice analysis | Validate functional impact | Aberrant splicing events |

## 3.4 Mapping to the UH2025Agent Architecture

The UH2025Agent translates the human Planner-Executor dynamic into a four-agent pipeline:

| Human Role | Agent Equivalent | Implementation |
|------------|------------------|----------------|
| Senior Diagnostician (Planner) | Structuring Agent | Qwen 2.5 (14B) with RAG retrieval |
| Bioinformatician (Executor) | Executor Agent | Python runtime + Bio-tools registry |
| Lab Director (Evaluator) | Evaluator Agent | Quality control, confidence scoring |
| Report Writer | Synthesis Agent | Qwen 2.5 (32B) markdown generation |

### 3.4.1 Decision Criteria for Tool Selection

The Structuring agent uses learned heuristics to select tools:

| Phenotype Pattern | Primary Tools | Secondary Tools | Confidence Threshold |
|-------------------|---------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Developmental delay + seizures | OMIM, AlphaMissense | Methylation, SV calling | 0.7 |
| Progressive ataxia | ExpansionHunter, STRipy | Mitochondrial analysis | 0.75 |
| Connective tissue features | CollagenDB, AlphaMissense | Structural modeling | 0.65 |
| Metabolic crisis | KEGG pathway, MetaboAnalyst | Enzyme activity assays | 0.8 |

## 3.5 From Manual to Agentic: Efficiency Gains

| Metric | Manual (Hackathon) | Agentic (UH2025Agent) | Improvement |
|--------|-------------------|----------------------|-------------|
| Time per hypothesis cycle | 2-4 hours | 5-15 minutes | 10-20x |
| Tool invocations per case | 10-20 (manual) | 50-100 (automated) | 5x coverage |
| Expert time required | 8-16 hours/case | 30-60 min review | 10-20x |
| Cases processable per day | 1-2 | 20-50 | 20-50x |
| Knowledge base coverage | Limited to team expertise | Full OMIM/ClinVar/literature | Complete |

The agentic workflow doesn't replace expert judgment—it amplifies it by automating the "Executor" grunt work and presenting the "Planner" with pre-filtered, annotated candidates.
