# Section 9: Challenges and Ethical Considerations

## Overview

This section addresses critical risks and ethical considerations: hallucination, data bias, and workforce impact.

> **Hackathon Foundation**
>
> The hackathon model embeds ethical safeguards by design:
> - **Human Pattern**: Experts constantly challenge each other's reasoning; no single voice dominates
> - **Discovery**: Discovery 6 (Bell Ceremony as checkpoint) + Discovery 3 (Real-Time Optimization)
> - **System Implementation**: Doctor-in-the-Loop ensures AI never operates unchecked; diverse Edge Nodes combat data colonialism
>
> *The hackathon's collaborative critique—where experts "roast" each other's hypotheses—becomes formalized as the Evaluator Agent and RLHF mechanism.*

## Key Concerns

1. **Hallucination Risk**: AI inventing plausible but incorrect facts
2. **Data Bias**: Eurocentric training data disadvantages diverse populations
3. **Workforce Adoption**: Alert fatigue, burnout, skill requirements

## Mitigations

- Evaluator agent for biological plausibility
- Doctor-in-the-loop for validation
- Diverse Edge Nodes for equitable training
- Force multiplier design (reduce, not add, workload)
