# Agent Context: Section 02 - The Hackathon

## 1. The Core Thesis
**A Hackathon is a Clinical Trial for Innovation.**
*   **The Event**: Sep 21-23, 2025. Mayo Clinic.
*   **The Participants**: Clinicians, Geneticists, AI Engineers, Families.
*   **The Method**: "Swarm Intelligence". Putting 50 experts in a room solves cases that 1 expert in an office cannot.

## 2. The Shift to Agents
*   **The Observation**: In previous hackathons, humans spent 80% of their time on data wrangling (parsing VCFs, searching PubMed).
*   **The Experiment**: In 2025, we introduced **AI Agents** to handle the wrangling.
*   **The Result**: Humans spent 80% of their time on *reasoning* and *validation*. The "Time to Candidate" dropped from 24 hours to 4 hours.

## 3. Key Successes
*   **Validation**: Cite specific (anonymized) wins. "Team X found a non-coding variant in Gene Y using the AlphaGenome agent."
*   **Community**: Emphasize that this is Open Source. The tools built here are available to everyone.

## 4. Narrative Arc
1.  **The Setup**: A room full of smart people and desperate families.
2.  **The Friction**: "We are drowning in data."
3.  **The Catalyst**: The Agents enter the chat.
4.  **The Breakthrough**: "Wait, the AI found a match in Japan."

## 5. Constraints
*   **Privacy**: Do NOT mention real patient names. Use "Patient A", "Family B".
*   **Credit**: Acknowledge the Wilhelm Foundation and Mayo Clinic as the conveners.
