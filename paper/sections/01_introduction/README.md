# Section 1: The Undiagnosed Program

## Overview

This section establishes the Undiagnosed Hackathon as the **conceptual foundation** for the entire paper. Rather than leading with problem statistics, we lead with the mission, the origin story, and the insight that the hackathon IS the model—in human form—for what we seek to automate.

**Core Thesis:** "The hackathon reveals the model; we automate the model."

## The Three-Layer Framework

The Undiagnosed Hackathon demonstrates three layers that inform all subsequent technology:

| Layer | What Happens | What It Teaches |
|-------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Immediate** | Diagnoses for waiting families (4/10 in 48 hours) | The workflow that actually solves cases |
| **Training** | Experts reason aloud, correct each other, generate tool lists | High-quality RLHF data from natural collaboration |
| **Validation** | Which tools/technologies get used in breakthrough moments | Discovery of what matters vs. what's theoretical |

## Narrative Structure

1. **The Cederroth Story** — Personal origin (three children lost to undiagnosed disease)
2. **The Mission** — "To ensure no family endures what they did"
3. **The Three-Layer Insight** — Immediate/Training/Validation framework
4. **The Diagnostic Odyssey** — Statistics as context for the mission
5. **The Thesis** — "The hackathon reveals the model; we automate the model"

## Key Statistics (Supporting Context)

- 7,000-10,000 unique rare conditions
- 350 million people affected worldwide ("third-largest country on Earth")
- Average 6 years to diagnosis
- 30% of children with rare diseases die before age 5
- 60% remain undiagnosed after WES
