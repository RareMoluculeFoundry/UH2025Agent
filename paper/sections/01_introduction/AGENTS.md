# Agent Context: Section 01 - Introduction

## 1. The Core Thesis
**The Diagnostic Odyssey is a solvable information problem.**
*   **The Status Quo**: 350 Million people. 5 years to diagnosis. 30% misdiagnosis rate.
*   **The Tragedy**: Most of these patients *have* data (exomes, medical records), but it is locked in silos or too complex for a human doctor to parse in a 15-minute visit.
*   **The Mission**: The Wilhelm Foundation does not accept "Undiagnosed" as a diagnosis.

## 2. Key Narrative Elements
*   **The Cederroth Legacy**: Mention Wilhelm, Hugo, and Emma. This is not just software; it is a legacy.
*   **The "Zip Code Lottery"**: If you are born near Boston or London, you get sequenced. If you are born in a rural area, you do not. Agentic AI democratizes this expertise.
*   **The "N=1" Paradox**: Rare diseases are individually rare but collectively common (more common than cancer + AIDS combined).

## 3. Technical Preview
*   Briefly tease the solution: "We propose a Federated, Agentic Architecture that allows a digital swarm of experts to review every case, every night."
*   Mention the **UH2025 Hackathon** as the proving ground for this technology.

## 4. Constraints
*   **Tone**: Empathic but rigorous. Do not be melodramatic, but do not be cold.
*   **Scope**: This section defines the *Problem*. Do not explain the *Solution* (AI) in depth yet; just hint at it.
