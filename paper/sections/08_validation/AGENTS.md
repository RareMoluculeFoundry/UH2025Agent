# Agent Context: Section 08 - Validation & Economics

## 1. The Core Thesis
**Accuracy is vital, but Scalability is existential.**
*   **The Metric**: It is not enough to be accurate (Sensitivity/Specificity). We must be *affordable* and *fast*.
*   **The Comparison**:
    *   *Human Geneticist*: High Accuracy, Low Scale (1 case/day), High Cost ($200/hr).
    *   *Agentic System*: High Accuracy (with RLHF), Infinite Scale (1000 cases/hr), Low Cost ($5/case).

## 2. Economic Proof
*   **Project Baby Bear**: Cite the $2.5M savings. Apply this logic to the Agent.
*   **The Cost of "No"**: Calculate the cost of 5 years of unnecessary MRIs, biopsies, and specialist visits.
*   **ROI**: If the Agent prevents *one* wrong surgery, it pays for 10,000 runs.

## 3. Clinical Validation
*   **Benchmarking**: Comparison against standard datasets (GIAB - Genome in a Bottle).
*   **The "Nostos" Dataset**: Use the "unsolvable" cases from previous years as a benchmark.
*   **Doctor-in-the-Loop**: Emphasize that the AI *proposes*, the Doctor *disposes*. The AI never makes a final diagnosis without human sign-off.

## 4. Narrative Arc
1.  **The Skepticism**: "Can AI really do this?"
2.  **The Data**: Show the confusion matrices and ROC curves (conceptual).
3.  **The Economics**: Show the dollar signs.
4.  **The Conclusion**: We cannot afford *not* to use this.

## 5. Constraints
*   **Conservatism**: Do not claim 100% accuracy. Admit false positives.
*   **Safety**: Highlight the role of the "Evaluator Agent" in catching hallucinations.
