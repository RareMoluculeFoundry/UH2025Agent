# Case Studies and Validation: Proof of Concept

## 8.1 The Hackathon Successes

The 2023-2025 Hackathons have provided the initial "training data" and validation for this concept. By solving cases that stumped standard care, they proved that deep, multi-modal integration works.

### Rothmund-Thomson Syndrome

In one notable case, the team used long-read sequencing to identify deep intronic variants in the DNA2 gene. This required a specific hypothesis ("check deep intronic regions") and a specific tool (long-read WGS), validating the "Planner-Executor" logic.[24]

**Key insights:**
- Variant invisible to standard short-read WGS
- Required targeted hypothesis generation
- Long-read technology was the critical differentiator

### Mosaicism Detection

Other cases involved the detection of low-level mosaicism, which is often filtered out by standard pipelines as noise. The "human swarm" identified this by adjusting the filtering thresholds—a heuristic that an Agentic AI could learn to apply.[27]

**Key insights:**
- Standard pipelines miss low-frequency variants
- Manual threshold adjustment was required
- Ideal candidate for learned heuristics

## 8.2 Nostos Genomics and AION

Industry players are already moving toward this model. Nostos Genomics has developed AION, an AI-driven platform for variant interpretation that acts as a "pre-screener" for bioinformaticians. Supported by investors linked to DeepMind, Nostos uses AI to prioritize variants, reducing the manual burden on geneticists. Their platform integrates tools like AlphaMissense, demonstrating the commercial viability of the "Agentic" approach.[51]

**Commercial validation:**
- Investor backing from DeepMind-connected sources
- Integration of AlphaMissense and other tools
- Pre-screening reduces geneticist workload
- Proof that agentic approach is market-viable
