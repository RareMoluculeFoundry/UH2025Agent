# Project Baby Bear: The Economic Case

## Overview

Project Baby Bear, a pilot program funded by the State of California and led by Rady Children's Institute for Genomic Medicine, demonstrated the economic viability of rapid Whole Genome Sequencing (rWGS) for critically ill infants. This project serves as a powerful economic argument for the "Rare Arena" model.

## Program Details

- **Funder**: State of California
- **Lead Institution**: Rady Children's Institute for Genomic Medicine
- **Target Population**: Critically ill infants
- **Intervention**: Rapid Whole Genome Sequencing (rWGS)

## Outcomes

The project sequenced 184 infants. Rapid diagnosis led to changes in clinical management for 65% of the diagnosed infants.[47]

## Table: Project Baby Bear Impact Analysis

| Impact Category | Statistic / Value |
|:----------------|:------------------|
| **Diagnostic Rate** | 43% of infants diagnosed (compared to <10% standard) [47] |
| **Management Change** | 65% of diagnosed infants had immediate care changes [47] |
| **Cost Savings (Total)** | $2.5 Million (Net savings after testing costs) [49] |
| **Inpatient Days Saved** | ~513 days avoided [49] |
| **Procedures Avoided** | 11 surgical/invasive procedures avoided [48] |
| **ROI** | $2.2–2.9M savings on a $1.7M investment [50] |

## Economic Analysis

### Investment
- Sequencing and precision medicine team: **$1.7 million**

### Returns
- Total healthcare savings: **$2.2–2.9 million**
- Net positive return: **$2.5 million**

### Cost Drivers Avoided
1. **Inpatient days**: ~513 hospital days not needed
2. **Surgical procedures**: 11 major procedures avoided
3. **Redundant testing**: Eliminated iterative diagnostics
4. **Inappropriate treatments**: Stopped ineffective interventions

## Implications for Agentic AI

This data proves that high-tech, upfront diagnosis is cost-saving. The "Rare Arena" model extends this logic:

1. **Deploy AI at the edge**: Every clinic becomes a genomics center
2. **Diagnose earlier**: Before costly hospitalizations
3. **Reduce unnecessary care**: Targeted treatment from day one
4. **Scale expertise**: AI trained by experts, deployed everywhere
