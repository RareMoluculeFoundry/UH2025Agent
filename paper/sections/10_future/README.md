# Section 10: From Event to Network — The Future

## Overview

This section presents the vision for transitioning from event-based hackathons to an always-on global diagnostic network.

> **Hackathon Foundation**
>
> The future is the hackathon made permanent:
> - **Human Pattern**: What happens when 100 experts gather for 48 hours must become available 24/7/365
> - **Discovery**: All Six Discoveries converge here—the network IS the hackathon, distributed and continuous
> - **System Implementation**: Federated infrastructure + RLHF training + edge deployment = "The Hackathon That Never Ends"
>
> *"The diagnostic odyssey ends when the hackathon effect reaches every clinic, every day."*

## The Transition

| Aspect | Hackathon (Today) | Network (Tomorrow) |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Frequency** | Annual, 48 hours | Always-on, 24/7 |
| **Participation** | 100+ experts present | Global edge nodes |
| **Knowledge** | Manual notes, tacit | RLHF-trained models |
| **Reach** | 10 families per event | Every clinic worldwide |
| **Data** | Stays in room | Stays at edge node |

## Vision

- **Autonomous Diagnosis**: 24/7 re-analysis as new literature emerges
- **Privacy Preserved**: Global knowledge without data movement
- **Democratized Care**: Expert access regardless of geography

## Strategic Recommendations

1. Invest in federated infrastructure (L1/L2/L3 architecture)
2. Adopt Doctor-in-the-Loop training (CME credit for RLHF participation)
3. Standardize the "Tool List" (WDL-like languages for reproducibility)

## The Call

**The technology exists. The model is proven. The mission is clear.**

The Cederroths lost three children because the expert knowledge that could have saved them was locked in silos. This system ensures that never happens again—by making the hackathon's collaborative intelligence available everywhere, always.
