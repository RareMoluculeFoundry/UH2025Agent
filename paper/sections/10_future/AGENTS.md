# Agent Context: Section 10 - Future Outlook

## 1. The Core Thesis
**The End of the Odyssey.**
*   **Current State**: Diagnosis is a "Project". It takes years and funding.
*   **Future State**: Diagnosis is a "Process". It runs in the background, every night, for every patient.
*   **The Mechanism**: The "Always-On" Agent.

## 2. The Living Diagnosis
*   **Concept**: A patient is sequenced once. Their data is stored locally.
*   **The Loop**: Every week, the Agent checks:
    1.  "Is there a new paper on this VUS?"
    2.  "Is there a new patient in the Swarm with this phenotype?"
    3.  "Is there a new therapy?"
*   **The Alert**: The doctor gets a notification only when the Agent finds a match.

## 3. Democratization
*   **The Vision**: A clinic in rural India should have access to the same diagnostic intelligence as a research hospital in Boston.
*   **The Agent as Equalizer**: Software scales. Experts do not.

## 4. Call to Action
*   **For Developers**: "Join the Open Source repo."
*   **For Hospitals**: "Join the Federation."
*   **For Families**: "Don't give up. The Swarm is searching."

## 5. Constraints
*   **Optimism vs. Realism**: Paint a bright future, but acknowledge the infrastructure work needed (EHR integration, cloud costs) to get there.
