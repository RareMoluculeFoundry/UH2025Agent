# Future Outlook: Towards a Democratized Standard of Care

## The Convergence

The convergence of Agentic AI, Federated Learning, and Multi-Omics creates a singular opportunity to end the diagnostic odyssey for millions of patients. The "Undiagnosed Hackathon" has served as the manual prototype for this future—a "human computer" that solves the unsolvable through collaboration and high-dimensional data.

## The Vision

By translating this human workflow into a "Rare Arena Network," we can scale this expertise. We envision a future where:

### Diagnosis is Autonomous

Agentic Planners run continuous, 24/7 re-analysis of patient data as new literature is published, ensuring that no case is ever truly "closed" until solved.

### Privacy is Preserved

Global knowledge is aggregated without moving a single patient genome, respecting the rights of patients and nations.

### Care is Democratized

The "virtual expert" is available to every patient, regardless of geography or socioeconomic status, leveling the playing field of global health.

## The Reality

The technology is no longer the bottleneck; the tools (AlphaMissense, Nanopore, Federated Learning) exist. The challenge now is implementation and integration. The transition from the "event-based" Hackathon to the "always-on" Network is the next logical step in the evolution of precision medicine, promising a future where the "diagnostic odyssey" becomes a relic of the past.

## Strategic Recommendations

### 1. Invest in Federated Infrastructure

Hospitals and research centers should prioritize "AI-ready" edge computing infrastructure to enable participation in federated networks.

### 2. Adopt "Doctor-in-the-Loop" Training

Medical boards should recognize AI interaction and critique as a valid form of Continuing Medical Education (CME) and contribution to the field, incentivizing clinician participation in model training.

### 3. Standardize the "Tool List"

The community must develop standardized languages (like Workflow Description Language - WDL) for expressing diagnostic logic so AI agents can reliably execute it across different platforms.

## From Hackathon to Network

| Aspect | Hackathon (Current) | Rare Arena Network (Future) |
|:-------|:--------------------|:---------------------------|
| **Frequency** | Annual event | Always-on |
| **Participation** | 100+ experts | Global network |
| **Cases** | 10-20 per event | Continuous intake |
| **Knowledge Capture** | Manual notes | RLHF-trained models |
| **Deployment** | None (one-time) | Edge nodes worldwide |

## Call to Action
