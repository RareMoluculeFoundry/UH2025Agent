## Chief Complaint

4-year-old female with refractory epilepsy, developmental delay, and recurrent febrile seizures seeking diagnostic clarification.

## History of Present Illness

Emma Chen is a 4-year-old previously healthy girl who presented with her first seizure at 6 months of age during a mild febrile illness (temperature 38.5°C). The seizure was prolonged (25 minutes), generalized tonic-clonic, and required emergency room intervention with IV lorazepam. Over the following months, she developed multiple seizure types:

**Seizure History:**
- **Age 6 months**: First febrile seizure (prolonged, 25 min)
- **Age 8 months**: Second febrile seizure (18 min), hemiclonic (right-sided)
- **Age 10 months**: First afebrile seizure, myoclonic jerks noted
- **Age 12-18 months**: Increasing seizure frequency, 2-4 per week
- **Age 2-3 years**: Developed absence seizures, continued myoclonic jerks
- **Age 3-4 years**: Nocturnal tonic-clonic seizures (1-2 per month)

Seizures are triggered by fever, warm baths, excitement, and photosensitivity (flashing lights). She has had three episodes of status epilepticus requiring hospitalization, most recently at age 3.5 years.

**Developmental Trajectory:**
- Met early milestones on time (sitting at 6 months, walking at 13 months)
- Language regression noted after age 18 months
- Current speech: 50-75 words, 2-word phrases
- Cognitive testing: Moderate intellectual disability (IQ estimated 45-50)
- Ataxic gait with frequent falls
- Behavioral concerns: autistic features, hyperactivity, sleep disturbances

**Current Antiepileptic Medications (Partial Response):**
1. Valproic acid 30 mg/kg/day - moderate response
2. Clobazam 0.5 mg/kg/day - adjunctive
3. Stiripentol 50 mg/kg/day - some improvement in convulsive seizures

**Failed Medications:**
- Carbamazepine - worsened seizures significantly
- Lamotrigine - worsened seizures
- Phenytoin - no benefit, exacerbated ataxia

## Past Medical History

- **Perinatal**: Full-term, uncomplicated vaginal delivery, APGAR 8/9
- **Neonatal**: Normal newborn screen
- **Growth**: Weight and height tracking at 25th percentile
- **Immunizations**: Up to date
- **Surgeries**: None
- **Hospitalizations**: 5 admissions for status epilepticus

## Family History

- **Mother**: 32 years, healthy, no seizure history
- **Father**: 35 years, healthy, febrile seizures in childhood (resolved by age 5)
- **Siblings**: 7-year-old brother, healthy
- **Paternal grandmother**: History of "fainting spells" in her 20s (not further characterized)
- **No known consanguinity**
- **Ethnic background**: Chinese-American

## Physical Examination

**Vitals**: T 37.0°C, HR 95, RR 22, BP 95/60, SpO2 99% on room air

**General**: Alert, interactive, small for age, mild hypotonia noted

**HEENT**: Normocephalic, no dysmorphic features

**Cardiovascular**: Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs

**Respiratory**: Clear to auscultation bilaterally

**Neurological Examination**:
- **Mental status**: Awake, follows simple commands, limited verbal output
- **Cranial nerves**: Intact, subtle nystagmus on lateral gaze
- **Motor**: Mild generalized hypotonia, proximal > distal weakness (4/5)
- **Reflexes**: 2+ throughout, no clonus
- **Coordination**: Ataxic gait, wide-based stance, intention tremor
- **Sensory**: Intact to light touch

**Skin**: No neurocutaneous stigmata, no café-au-lait spots

## Diagnostic Studies

**EEG Findings**:
- Background: Diffusely slow for age
- Interictal: Generalized spike-wave and polyspike-wave discharges (2.5-3 Hz)
- Photosensitivity: Present at 15-20 Hz
- Focal: Occasional left temporal sharp waves

**MRI Brain** (Age 3 years):
- Normal structural anatomy
- No hippocampal sclerosis
- No cortical malformations

**Laboratory Studies**:
- Complete metabolic panel: Normal
- Lactate/pyruvate: Normal
- Ammonia: Normal
- Urine organic acids: Normal
- Plasma amino acids: Normal
- Acylcarnitine profile: Normal

**Genetic Testing Completed**:
- Chromosomal microarray: Normal (no pathogenic CNVs)
- Epilepsy gene panel (50 genes): Negative (2023)

## Clinical Impression

This is a 4-year-old female with a clinical presentation highly concerning for **Dravet syndrome** (Severe Myoclonic Epilepsy of Infancy, SMEI):

**Supporting Features**:
1. Onset of prolonged febrile seizures in the first year of life
2. Progression to multiple seizure types (myoclonic, absence, tonic-clonic)
3. Temperature sensitivity and photosensitivity
4. Normal early development with subsequent regression
5. Ataxia and cognitive impairment
6. Worsening with sodium channel blockers (carbamazepine, lamotrigine)
7. Partial response to Dravet-specific medications (valproate, stiripentol, clobazam)

**Differential Diagnosis**:
1. Dravet syndrome (SCN1A mutation) - Most likely
2. SCN1A-negative Dravet-like syndrome (SCN1B, SCN2A, GABRA1, GABRG2)
3. Epilepsy with myoclonic-atonic seizures (Doose syndrome)
4. Other genetic epileptic encephalopathy

**Recommendation**: Whole exome sequencing to identify causative mutation, with particular attention to SCN1A and related genes.
